                 <p> <h4> Cristobal Ortega is Club <br> America’s record appearances holder, turning out 711 times for the Eagles’ between 1974 and 1992.<br>
	
                 <br>Their leading scorer on the other hand is Luis Roberto Alves, who found the net 190 times across two separate spells at the Azteca Stadium in the 1980s and 1990s.<br>

 	<br>In terms of the current squad, Bruno Valdez is the club’s longest serving player, featuring 217 times since he made the switch from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno in July 2016.<br>

    <br>However, it’s captain Guillermo Ochoa who has made the most appearances – with 399 to his name across two separate spells from 2004-2011 and 2019-present.<br>

                 <h2> Domestic Success</h2>
                
               <p> <h4> Club America are one of Mexico’s most successful sides, as demonstrated by a hugely impressive domestic record.Their first league title came in 1924/25 when they were still operating as an amateur outfit but, after turning professional, their first Liga MX title came in 1965/66.</h4> </p>

                 <h2>Leagues cup</h2>
   <br> <h4> Club America was eliminated from the Leagues Cup in the wildest way possible against Nashville SC. Club america was cheated out of being in the quater finals.The Liga MX team had already advanced to the quarterfinals after a sudden death of the penalty kick series, or so everyone thought before the referee received a call stating that VAR showed America keeper Luis Malagon had stepped off his line in the penalty that won them the game. What was crazy was the Nashville teams goalie had also steped off the line but that play was not called up to the VAR.
        <br> The referee, Honduras' Selvin Brown, then had to bring back the teams into action even though fans had stormed the field and Nashville SC was already heading into the locker room in a chaotic scene that will be remembered for a long time.</h4>

                 <h2> Rivalry </h2>
                 
<br> <h4> Considered the two most popular teams in Mexico, El Super Clasico first began in the 1950s when the two teams squared off in the Mexican League. After Chivas won the first game 1-0, America spanked their highly fancied opponents 7-2 in the next game, and thus the rivalry was seemingly born.</h4> <br>
